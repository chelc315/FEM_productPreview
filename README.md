## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first time coding a site using mobile-first design. I initially used an img tag for the big photo but found trouble when I had to change it to a different file for the desktop version. I ended up converting it to a div tag and used the CSS 'background' property to set the image url, both initally and then in my media query for the larger size.

### Continued development

I'm starting to understand how to better use classes to repeat styles without having to repeat code but there's still room for improvement!
